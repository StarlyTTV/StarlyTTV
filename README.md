# About me #

Hi, I'm Starly

I'm a Streamer and YouTuber, mostly of Nintendo Games.

The reason why I made a Github Account and make these Repositories is, that I wanna make every Mod I use for a Stream / Video as accessible as possible.

I'm planning on creating a bunch of different Mods for Games myself, because there are many ideas that I wanna try out.
